- üîí **Secure Generation**: Uses `/dev/urandom` on Unix systems with secure fallback for Windows
- üìè **Flexible Length**: Generate passwords from 12 to 512 characters
- üéØ **Smart Defaults**: Sensible 16-character default length
- üß© **Character Diversity**: Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository or download the script
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x generate_password.sh
   ```
3. Run it:
   ```bash
   ./generate_password.sh
   ```

## üíª Usage

```bash
# Generate default 16-character password
./generate_password.sh

# Generate custom length password (e.g., 32 characters)
./generate_password.sh 32

# Show help
./generate_password.sh --help
```

## üìñ Examples

```bash
$ ./generate_password.sh
q,/M-OUG,7#ei3T:    # 16 characters (default)

$ ./generate_password.sh 32
Kj#9f@mP2$nL5vX8&qR4wY7*hN3cA!bE  # 32 characters

$ ./generate_password.sh 12
Ht7$mK9v@pL2    # 12 characters (minimum)
```

## üîß Technical Details

The script uses two methods for generating passwords:

1. Primary Method (Unix-like systems):
   - Uses `/dev/urandom` for cryptographically secure random generation
   - Filtered through `tr` for character selection

2. Fallback Method (Windows):
   - Uses Bash's `$RANDOM` with modular arithmetic
   - Implements secure character selection algorithm
